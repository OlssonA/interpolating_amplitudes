# Interpolating Amplitudes

This repository contains the implementations of the interpolation methods described in the paper [2412.09534](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09534), as well as the testfunctions used for the benchmarks.

**Interpolation methods**  
The repository contains implementations of the following interpolation methods
* **Sparse Grids** (with modified extrapolating basis as well as extended not-a-knot B-spline and boundaryless B-spline basis functions)
* **B-splines** (uniform or not-a-knot constructions)
* **Polynomial Interpolation** (with Chebyshev polynomials)
* **Machine Learning** with MLP and Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformers [(L-GATr)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14806)

**Compilation of the testfunctions**  
To compile GoSam run..
